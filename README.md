## Notes

To start working with TypeScript, you first need to check if you have it installed on your computer with the ```tsc -v``` command on your terminal. If you don't see any TypeScript version on your terminal, you need to run the ```npm install -g typescript``` command to install it globally.

Once you have TypeScript installed, you need to run the ```tsc --init``` command to generate a ```tsconfig.json``` file and set it up as it is in the task folders.

After you write your TypeScript code, you need to run the ```tsc yourFileName.ts``` command to transpile it to JavaScript code. If you want ot run your JavaScript code, you should run the ```node yourFileName.js``` command.

Please keep in mind that if you want to use the materials from ```07-workshop``` folder after downloading the repository, you should run the ```npm install``` command into your VS Code terminal to generate the ```node_modules``` folder.

If the terminal starts throwing you array method errors, just change the VS Code terminal from ```PowerShell``` to ```Command Prompt```.
